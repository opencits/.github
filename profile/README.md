# C-ITS

C-ITS stands for “Cooperative Intelligent Transport System.” 

It describes connected road-transport systems in which vehicles and infrastructure share information about traffic and hazardous situations (for example, obstacles, congestion, icy roads, or aquaplaning). 

By exchanging these observations, participants can coordinate responses such as warning drivers, slowing down, or rerouting to improve safety and traffic flow.

These repositories are at the very beginning of a journey. 

Some of the work here is done using agentic engineering, (maybe) bringing lots of ideas from recent years to the ground. 

Goals and roadmap are still a to-do.
