# C-ITS

C-ITS stands for “Cooperative Intelligent Transport System.” 

It describes connected road-transport systems in which vehicles and infrastructure share information about traffic and hazardous situations (for example, obstacles, congestion, icy roads, or aquaplaning). 

By exchanging these observations, participants can coordinate responses such as warning drivers, slowing down, or rerouting to improve safety and traffic flow.

This repository is at the very beginning of a journey. 

Much of the work here is done using agentic engineering, maybe bringing lots of ideas from recent years to the ground with the giant help of AI. 

Goals and roadmap are still a to-do.
